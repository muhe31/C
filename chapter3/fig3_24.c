/*
(Find the Largest Number) The process of finding the largest number
(i.e., the maximum of a group of numbers) is used frequently in computer
applications. For example, a program that determines the winner of a
sales contest would input the number of units sold by each salesperson.
The salesperson who sold the most units wins the contest.
Write a pseudocode program and then a program that inputs a series of
10 numbers and determines and prints the largest of the numbers.
[Hint: Your program should use three variables as follows]:
*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){

  int counter;
  int number;
  int largest;
}
