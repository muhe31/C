/*(Sales Commission Calculator) One large chemical company pays
its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per
week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example,
a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200
plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input
each salespersonâ€™s gross sales for last week and will calculate and display
that salesperson's earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a time.
